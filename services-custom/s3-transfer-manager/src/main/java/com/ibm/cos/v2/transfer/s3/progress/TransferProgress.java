/**
 * {@link TransferProgress} is a <b>stateful</b> representation of the progress of a transfer initiated by {@link
 * S3TransferManager}. {@link TransferProgress} offers the ability to take a {@link #snapshot()} of the current progress,
 * represented by an immutable {@link TransferProgressSnapshot}, which contains helpful progress-related methods like {@link
 * TransferProgressSnapshot#transferredBytes()} and {@link TransferProgressSnapshot#ratioTransferred()}. {@link TransferProgress}
 * is attached to {@link ObjectTransfer} objects, namely {@link Upload}, {@link Download}, and {@link Copy}.
 * <p>
 * Where possible, it is typically recommended to <b>avoid</b> directly querying {@link TransferProgress} and to instead leverage
 * the {@link TransferListener} interface to receive event-driven updates of the latest {@link TransferProgressSnapshot}. See the
 * {@link TransferListener} documentation for usage instructions. However, if desired, {@link TransferProgress} can be used for
 * poll-like checking of the current progress. E.g.,
 * <pre>{@code
 * Upload upload = tm.upload(...);
 * while (!upload.completionFuture().isDone()) {
 *     upload.progress().snapshot().ratioTransferred().ifPresent(System.out::println);
 *     Thread.sleep(1000);
 * }
 * }</pre>
